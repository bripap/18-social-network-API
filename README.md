# Social Network API
## 18 NoSQL: Social Network API

## Task

```md
Build an API for a social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friends' thoughts, and create a friend list. 

Use Express.js for routing, a MongoDB database, and the Mongoose ODM. In addition, you may optionally use a JavaScript date library of your choice or the native JavaScript `Date` object to format timestamps.

No seed data is provided, so you’ll need to create your own data using Insomnia after you’ve created your API.
```

## Technologies used:

```md
Express JS    
MongoDB     
Mongoose     
MomentJS     
```


## User Story

```md
AS A social media startup
I WANT an API for my social network that uses a NoSQL database
SO THAT my website can handle large amounts of unstructured data
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```md
GIVEN a social network API
WHEN I enter the command to invoke the application
THEN my server is started and the Mongoose models are synced to the MongoDB database
WHEN I open API GET routes in Insomnia for users and thoughts
THEN the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON
WHEN I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia
THEN I am able to successfully create, update, and delete users and thoughts in my database
WHEN I test API POST and DELETE routes in Insomnia
